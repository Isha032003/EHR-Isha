# 🧠 GenAI-Powered Medical Image Enhancement

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **Generative AI-powered image enhancement model** that denoises, sharpens, and reconstructs medical images for improved diagnostic support.  
It compares **classical enhancement methods (BM3D + Upscaling)** with a **deep learning-based** and **Azure OpenAI GenAI** approach using quantitative metrics such as **PSNR** and **SSIM**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🧩 Apply **GenAI techniques** for image denoising and realistic reconstruction.  
- 🔍 Enhance **resolution and clarity** for better visualization of diagnostic images.  
- ⚖️ Compare **Classical (BM3D)** vs **AI-based (CNN + Azure OpenAI)** methods.  
- 📊 Compute **PSNR** and **SSIM** metrics for evaluation.  
- ☁️ Demonstrate **integration of Azure OpenAI** for GenAI-based image enhancement.
